-  ｡✦ <samp> > Ponies of mine marked "introj" represent introjects in my system (& may not be accurate to source because neither are my alters) and ponies marked "sys" are not they're just for funny sillies. Neither necessarily indicate fronting </samp>

-  ｡✦ <samp> > I don't take horse game that seriously, so I don't really care what you do (boop/sneeze/whatever). I only ask you don't be weird or sexual to me I have a partner. I don't really understand touch discomfort stuff, but I'll respect it because it's really not that deep </samp>

-  ｡✦ <samp> > Usually I am down to chat about whatever (inluding media that my pony skins are from) but I have a hard time keeping up with the ponytown chat bc of my disabilities, so whisper/dming helps </samp>

-  ｡✦ <samp> > You can ask for my discord in DMs but if you do please read <a href="https://vulpecula.straw.page/">my strawpage</a> and make sure you follow my DNI and such first! I'm on discord far more than I am ponytown </samp>
